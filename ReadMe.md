# GOALS

This is a simple HTML parser in C++.

Assumes C++20, mostly because that's what I currently use. Header-only, no external dependencies.

The main purpose is to let me get the data from certain Steam webpages, so that's also my main "testing".

I still made this a separate project, so I can maybe use it in other projects as well. Thus, I'm somewhat interested in fixing problems with other pages... if it's not too much work.

# STANDARDS COMPLIANCE

* "what's that?"
* it reads some semblance of HTML
* I've tried following a W3C document that I found, but it seems
  I didn't read it properly
* there's been trial-and-error to get webpages to parse

# KNOWN SHORTCOMINGS

* doesn't handle "tag soup" and other invalid markup; this might be complicated to do
* the list of named character references is woefully incomplete
* no information on errors
* assumes UTF-8 input, and creates UTF-8 output

# STUFF THAT IT DOESN'T WANT TO DO

* no query functions -- just walk through the tree yourself
* probably not a benchmark winner

# USAGE

If you have an UTF-8 encoded webpage, parse it like this:

```
#include "HTMLParser/Parser.hpp"

void example()
{
    std::string html="â€¦";
    ...
    HTMLParser::Parser parser(html);
    HTMLParser::Tree::Document document=parser.parse();
}
```

Refer to the `HTMLParser/Tree.hpp` file for the document data; it should be rather straightforward.

You can also subclass the `Parser` class to learn about elements when they are created:

```
class MyParser : public HTMLParser::Parser
{
   using Parser::Parser;

public:
   virtual ~MyParser() =default;

   virtual void gotElement(const HTMLParser::Tree::Element& element) override
   {
   }
};
```

This lets you build lookup structures as elements are created (of course, you can just walk through the tree afterwards instead).

Note that you'll get the elements AFTER they have been fully read -- they will have all child nodes, and be linked to their parent element. Still, that parent element is still in the process of reading the children, so its children list may not be complete yet.
